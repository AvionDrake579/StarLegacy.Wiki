# Printers

Printers are machines that turn cobblestone and energy into various materials.

## Using a printer

* Ensure the sign has power \(accepts power through noteblock\).
* Then, put a focusing lens \(prismarine crystals\) in the top slot.
* Next, put cobblestone in the fuel slot.
* The printer should now begin converting.

## Printer Multiblock

* Red blocks are replaced with the **machinery blocks**.
* The blue block is replaced with the **core block**.
* The white block is replaced with the **product block**.

## Carbon Processor

Carbon processors simply process raw concrete powder into concrete.

Using a carbon processor is the same as a printer.

* Except that you must use graxene\(concrete\) powder rather than cobblestone.

> The color of the product is determined by the color of the stained glass in the center.

### Multiblock

* 1x noteblock
* 1x hopper
* 4x iron block
* 2x sponge
* 2x glass
* 4x glass pane
* 1x dropper
* 1x gold block
* 1x stained glass
