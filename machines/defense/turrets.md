# Turrets

Turrets are multiblock structures useful for larger ships and base defense platforms.

## Using Turrets

* With a controller in hand, right click the turret sign.
* Once inside, simply looking around rotates and aims the turret.
* Left click with the controller to fire!
* To exit, just right click.

## Creating A Turret Sign

* Must be directly below \(or above\) the center of the sponge blocks under the turret. 
* 2 blocks below \(or above\)
* The first line must say \[turret\].
* The second line needs the axis \(e.g. "top" or "bottom"\).
