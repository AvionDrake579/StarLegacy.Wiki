# Wires

## Wires

Wires are similar to pipes, except they transfer power between machines.

## Wire Logics

There are many relevant blocks for power transfer.

### Noteblock

There is a note block on every power machine multiblock.

* They are used for power input.
* Extractors can also extract from them.

### Extractor

Extractors are crafting tables and you will often find these on many of the power machines.

* They can extract power into wires and connectors.

  * The more extractors you have in a chunk, the less they are ticked. 

  > All extractors tick used or not, so making use of all extractors is most efficent.

### Wire

Wires \(end rods\) are the fastest and best for simple long distance power transfer.

* They can only go straight forward.
* They can take power from iron/redstone blocks, connectors, extractors, and other wires.
* They can give power to any of the above plus noteblocks and minus extractors.

### Connectors

Also known as technical \(or sponge blocks\), these blocks are like wires except:

* They can transfer power from all sides. 
* They can't take power from iron blocks. However, they can still give power to iron blocks.

### Iron/Redstone Blocks

These are like sponge blocks, but with a few key differences.

* They cannot give power to sponges and they can't take power from extractors.
* They also give power to the block opposite of the direction they took power from if one is available.
