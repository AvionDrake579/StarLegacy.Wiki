# Hyperdrives

## Hyperdrives

Hyperdrives allow faster-than-lightspeed travel, drastically cutting travel time.

### Usage

* First, build a hyperdrive in your starship. 
* Then, fill the hoppers with Chetherite \(minimum 1 per hopper\). 

_**Navigating a jump can be done one of two ways:**_

* Use one of the hyperspace beacons found in every system.
* To do this, simply fly up to one and click on the button in the chat message it sends you.
* You can also build and use a navigation computer [\(Info here\)](https://starlegacy.net/wiki/old_pages/navigation_computer).

## Tiers

* There are 4 classes of hyperdrives.
* The higher the class, the more hypermatter is required to use them \(more hoppers\). 
* Higher classes can make you go faster, although the effect is greater for larger ships.

## Multiblocks
