# New Player Guide

Welcome! This guide will teach you the basics of the server.

## Getting Started

The interstellar government gave you some omoney from the refugee funds. 
Use it to get a ship from the ship dealer and fly to a planet!

### Basic Gear

You need to wear a space suit to survive in space.
Use `/kit space` to get one!

You'll also need a ship controller to fly ships and be visible on the map.
Use `/kit controller` to get one.

A nice kit that comes with all the good stuff is `/kit starter`, but be careful - you can only use that once a week!

### Map

The server has a web-based map which allows you to view all of the planets, space, people flying ships, and more!

To open the map, click [here](/map). Alternatively, use `/map` on the server to get a link. 

#### Finding Yourself
* Hold the controller you got (more info [here](#basic_gear))
* Look at the bottom right of the map page, at the player list
* Find your name, and click on it

> If you can't find your name, try scrolling with the arrows

### Getting a ship
In the station, find the "Ship Dealer" NPC. Right click it and buy a shuttle.
Congratulations, you now have your very own space shuttle!
*Who needs NASA, anyway?*

### Flying a ship
After getting a ship from the ship dealer, it comes pre-detected for you.
However, you usually need to detect it yourself, so do it for practice:

* Use /release to release in case you're already piloted
* Left click the ship computer with the controller
* Click the controller button, labeled "re-detect"

> There are other things you can do in that menu.
> Most importantly there is locking - if you enable the lock,
> when you release the ship it will start a 5 minute timer.
> At the end of the timer, if it wasn't repiloted,
> it'll lock and nobody who is not added as a pilot can break blocks on it.

There, you detected it! Now, try piloting it by **right clicking the computer**. It should say "You have boarded a starship piloted by [your name]"

Now that you've piloted it, you can fly your ship! **There are 3 basic ways to move your ship:**

> You must be piloting the ship and holding the controller to do these

1. "Shift" Flying

Shift flying lets you move precisely over short distances and maneuver. **Don't use this for flying around space!**

To shift fly, hold the controller in your hand and face the direction you intend to move the ship.
Hold the sneak key (default `LEFT SHIFT`). Your ship should move in the direction you're facing.

> If it says your ship is obstructed, something is in the way of your ship!
> You'll need to move a different direction to get out of the path of whatever's blocking it.

#### 2. Cruising

Cruising is how you travel over long distances.  

To cruise, you need a cruise sign. Spawn ships come with these, but if you make your own,
place a sign and put `[cruise]` on the first line, then right click it.

Now that you have a functional cruise sign, right click it with the controller.
Your ship will move in the approximate direction you were facing.

> To navigate properly with cruise, see which cardinal direction it is to your destination using the map.
> In-game, use the info scoreboard to see which way you are facing (N = north, E = east, S = south, W = west)

#### 3. Steering

Starships can change directions using helm signs.

If your ship doesn't have one yet, make a sign that says `[helm]` on the first line, and right click it.

Now that you have a helm sign, right click it with a controller.
Your ship should turn right! Left click it, and it should turn left.

> Another way to rotate is using the drop and switch to offhand keys.
> To turn right, drop the controller (default key `Q`).
> To turn left, switch it to your offhand (default key `F`).

#### Tips
* If there's a block in the way of your ship, you can't go that way.
* Stained glass blocks act as "hangar doors". You can fly ships through them, and they reappear when it exits them.
* Remember to click on your name on the map again after switching worlds
* To unpilot your ship, do `/release` or right click the computer.
* To protect your ship, lock it!

### Shooting
After learning how to pilot your ship you must now learn how to use it in combat. To shoot heavy weapons such as heavy lasers and torpedoes double right click. There is a cool down on these weapons so you will have to wait until they are reloaded so use them wisely. For weapons such as cannons and pulses normal left click will fire them. Depending on how much energy your ship has and the amount of these weapons you have it'll dictate the cool down for pulses and cannons. 

### What Next
Now that you know the basics of flying a ship, there are a number of things you can do. You can pick a rank track (/ranktrack) (though you should wait till you can handle pirates), you can make money (which is used to rank up if you are a colonist!), you can bake cake, you can build a ship, you can make a claim or start a settlement, you can JOIN a settlement or nation, and you can go check out the creative server!

Picking a rank track is important but you shouldn't do it just yet, as pirates can kill you for points if you do. 

There are several ways to make money. You can trade with other players, ship cargo between the stations (see [https://www.starlegacy.enjin.com/wiki/m/44193093/page/Cargo_Trading here]), or you can sell items to the importer. To see how much an item sells for, use /value. The importer comes in two forms: An NPC named after the system (e.g. "Sobrii Importer") or the importer chest (available in some areas of eco stations). 

If you want to make trade deals with other players, you can join our Discord server and communicate with the hundreds of other players on the server! Invite link: https://discord.gg/RdRCVkM

If you want to join a settlement, you can also join that and go to the #recruiting channel.

If you want to make a small personal claim to protect some stuff, use /claim. To expand it, stand inside it and use /expandclaim. If you want to claim a large plot of land on a planet, use /settlement create <name>. The amount of money it takes depends on the size of a territory, a very small piece of land could be 1,000 credits while a huge one could be as much as 20,000 credits. 

Finally, you can check out the creative server on /server creative. By default, you can claim one alpha plot (a 64x64 plot). You can donate for bigger plots at https://www.starlegacy.enjin.com/shop . If you want some inspiration, it is recommended that you go to /warp spaceplots and see what other people have built.

### Getting to Planets
In the system you start in there are several planets. Open the map (/map) and look at the system on the top left, where you start. Find a planet and see which way to go to get to, then fly to its icon. To enter a planet just fly into it. Once you get there, make sure that you don't land in claimed land - you won't be able to build there.
### Getting to Neighboring Systems
In other systems like Frigus and Ignum, you may find interesting planets with items that cannot be found in Sobrii. To get there, you will need a [[Hyperdrives|hyperdrive]]. A hyperdrive runs on Cheterite for fuel, which can be mined on asteroids. With your hyperdrive fueled and ready, head to one of the hyperspace beacons of the corresponding system you're heading to. These beacons look like nether portals on the map. To use the hyperdrive at these beacons you must fly very close to the beacon which is a space station. When you get close enough in chat a message will pop up telling you to accept or deny the hyperspace jump to the solar system it is designated to send you to. With help of the hyperdrive, you can also establish trade routes between systems which import and export crates from or to other systems. For more info, check out [[Cargo_Trading|the page on cargo trading]]. Once you've unlocked a [[Navigation_Computers|navigation computer]], you can use it to go through hyperspace to any point in space. However, you may get caught in mass shadows like dark matter, planets, or stars. The best way remains to be using hyperspace beacons.

### Cryopod
Now that you're on a planet, you should build [s]wall[/s] a cryopod. A cryopod is where you'd respawn if you die. If a cryopod gets destroyed, obstructed, or moved, you will respawn at the eco station instead. You also can not have more than one cryopod active at one time. You can acquire the basic materials you need from `/kit cryo`. (7 day cooldown) After building your cryopod, put a sign with "[cryopod]" on the first line and right-click on the sign to activate it. Below is the simplest basic design for a cryopod. You should cover your cryopod with more blocks or even hide it to prevent it being destroyed. For more info use `/info cryopod`
- Note: Cryopods can be placed on ships.

### Re-textured blocks
In this server you may encounter several different terms used for blocks and new minerals alike. To maximize your experience, it is recommended to use the provided server resource pack which can also be downloaded offline [https://github.com/Miclebrick/StarLegacyResourcepack/blob/master/StarLegacyPack.zip?raw=true here].
Here's an example of blocks which have been re-textured or renamed:
![Image](https://i.imgur.com/rxwpHkc.png)
Left to right:
* Starship Computer (Jukebox), Sponge (Technical Block), End Rod (Wire), Redstone Lamp (Tier 2 Thruster), Glowstone (Tier 1 Thruster).
* Piston, Furnace, Crafting Table (Extractor), Graxene Powder (Concrete Powder), Coal Ore.
* Dropper, Dispenser, Iron Block, Carbyne (Concrete), Coal Block.
* Copper Ore, Aluminum Ore, Chetherite Ore, Titanium Ore, Uranium Ore.
* Copper Block, Aluminum Block, Chetherite Block, Titanium Block, Uranium Block.
**Note: Iron bars and Stone bricks are also retextured

### Added Crafting Recipes
* Sea Lantern can be crafted out of 4x Focusing Lens (Prismarine Crystals) and vice versa.
* [[Power_Gear|Power Gear]].
* Copper, Aluminum, Chetherite, Titanium, and Uranium Blocks out of 9x of each respective item.
* 16x Wire (End Rod) can be crafted out of 3x Copper Ingots.

### Ranks and Advancements
Meanwhile, you should decide on a [[Ranks|rank path]] (`/ranktrack`).

After choosing a rank path, you may now earn points. Points can be used to rank up, unlocking bigger ship types and making higher tier advancements available to unlock. Colonists get points by getting money (money = points, losing money = losing points and ranking up takes money) and pirates/privateers get points from kills.

Advancements are unlockable technologies which can be implemented to your ship, defenses, or automatons (more on that later). They also cost points to unlock, increasingly more expensive the higher the tier. Advancements can be implemented on ships, defenses, and automatons. [Click here to jump to Advancements](#main-features).

### Claiming Land
Now with a base set up you should protect it using GriefPrevention, or GP for short. You can do a basic claim using `/claim`. To do more advanced stuff like custom sizes and shapes, you'll need a golden shovel (gold can be acquired on asteroids). You may only have one GP claim in a world, but you can expand them later with a golden shovel. For more info, you should check out the tutorial in this [video on YouTube](http://bit.ly/mcgpuser).

> Warning: Claiming an area to protect a ship while in space is against the rules! Only use claim to protect your builds. However, you may still park your ship within this area, given that it's within your build area i.e. your base.''
