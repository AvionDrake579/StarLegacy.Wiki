# Nations and Settlements

Settlements You can claim unclaimed regions as settlements. To create one, use the command, in game; /s create 

When you do this, it will tell you the price and ask you to confirm.

To keep a claim at least 1 member must have logged in within 21days. If no members of the settlement have logged in after 21days have passed the settlement is automatically purged and deleted. The land is unclaimed \(for the only exception read below under nation claimed settlements\) and anyone can pillage and grief and steal from it.

Bonus: Every day for every active member who has logged in the past 3 days the nations bank will increase by 10 credits. For example: 3 members are in a nation and all log in every day, the nation would get 300 credits per day. 2 members log in but one does not they will receive 30 credits per day for only 3 days, after that if the person who hasn't logged in doesn't log in the nation will increase by only 20 credits per day if the other two members are active.

Note: This is ONLY legal if it is in unclaimed land. Command: /s info

This command will give you a list of the people in your settlement, their ranks, and other very useful information about your settlement.

This command can also be used to see other settlements:

Nations Nations are useful in claiming more regions around your settlement and on other various planets.

Nations will also be deleted if the capital settlement is auto purged and there is no member settlement with an active leader that can be automatically made the new capital

Bonus: Every day for every active member who has logged in the past 3 days the nations bank will increase by 100 credits. For example: 3 members are in a nation and all log in every day, the nation would get 300 credits per day. 2 members log in but one does not they will receive 300 credits per day for only 3 days, after that if the person who hasn't logged in doesn't log in the nation will increase by only 200 credits per day if the other two members are active.
