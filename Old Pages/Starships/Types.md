# Starship Types
Every starship has a type.
Starship types have their own stats.
These include block size limits, power output, and container percent.

They are split into freighters and warships.

You unlock these by ranking up. Everyone has shuttle by default.
Ranking up as a colonist gets you freighters a rank earlier than others, 
and ranking up as a pirate or privateer gets you warships
a rank earlier than colonists.

#### Examples
* Colonists get transports at rank 2,
  but pirates and privateers get it at rank 3.

* Pirates and privateers get starfighters at rank 1,
  colonists get them at rank 2.

* Pirates and privateers get cruisers at rank 5,
  colonists get them at rank 6.

Cargo percent is the percent of blocks that can be inventory blocks.
Chests count as three inventory blocks.
