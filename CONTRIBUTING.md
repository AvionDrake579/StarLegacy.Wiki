## Formatting
The wiki uses [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/). For a quick tutorial on using it, [see here](https://commonmark.org/help/)!

## Editing
There are many editors available for Markdown files.
We recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
Use one of the Markdown extensions.

## Making Contributions
Try to keep your changes minimal. Don't make a bunch of changes to a bunch of pages all at once.
Make targetted, related changes. If you're adding new things, don't add anything else in that contribution.
You can use branches on your repository to split changes up.
