## Quick Notes

This sector is almost always uninhabited, rarely being visited by anyone.
However, 
this does not dissuade players from coming here for rare resources.
Arknovus is an example of this, being the only settlement to have created a space station in 7a as of writing this.
Should you be unlucky enough to be sent to 7a by the staff,
bewhere the wrath of the space whales.
